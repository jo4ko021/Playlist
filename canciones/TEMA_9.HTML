        <P>
            How long, how long will I slide?
            <BR>Separate my side, I don't
            <BR>I don't believe it's bad
            <BR>Slit my throat it's all I ever
        </P>
        <P>
            I heard your voice through a photograph
            <BR>I thought it up and brought up the past
            <BR>Once you know you can never go back
            <BR>I gotta take it on the other side
        </P>
        <P>
            Centuries are what it meant to me
            <BR>A cemetery where I marry the sea
            <BR>Stranger things could never change my mind
            <BR>I gotta take it on the other side
            <BR>Take it on the other side
            <BR>Take it on, take it on
        </P>
        <P>
            How long, how long will I slide?
            <BR>Separate my side, I don't
            <BR>I don't believe it's bad
            <BR>Slit my throat it's all I ever
        </P>
        <P>
            Pour my life into a paper cup
            <BR>The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
            <BR>She wants to know, am I still a slut?
            <BR>I've got to take it on the other side
        </P>
        <P>
            A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
            <BR>A candidate for a soul mate bled
            <BR>Push the trigger and pull the thread
            <BR>I gotta take it on the other side
            <BR>Take it on the other side
            <BR>Take it on
            <BR>Take it on
        </P>
        <P>
            How long, how long will I slide?
            <BR>Separate my side, I don't
            <BR>I don't believe it's bad
            <BR>Slit my throat it's all I ever
        </P>
        <P>
            Burn me out, leave me on the other side
            <BR>I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
            <BR>I tear it down, I tear it down
            <BR>And then it's born again
        </P>
        <p>
            How long, how long will I slide?
            <BR>Separate my side, I don't
            <BR>I don't believe it's bad
            <BR>Slit my throat it's all I ever
        </p>
        <P>
            How long, I don't, I don't believe it's bad
            <BR>Slit my throat it's all I ever
