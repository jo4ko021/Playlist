            City's breaking down on a camel's back
            <BR>They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
            <BR>So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
            <BR>You won't get out the county 'cause you're bad and free
            <BR>You've got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
            <BR>A melancholy town where we never smile
            <BR>And all I wanna hear is the message beep
            <BR>My dreams, they got a kissing, 'cause I don't get sleep, no
