        <h1>Gangsta´s paradise - Coolio ft. L.V.</h1>
        <P>
            As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
            <BR>I take a look at my life, and realize there's nothin' left
            <BR>'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
            <BR>That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
        </P>
        <P>
            But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
            <BR>Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
            <BR>You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
            <BR>Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
        </P>
        <P>
            I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
            <BR>As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
            <BR>Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
            <BR>On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight
        </P>
        <P>
            Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
            <BR>Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
            <BR>Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
            <BR>Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
        </P>
        <P>
            Look at the situation they got me facin'
            <BR>I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
            <BR>So I gotta be down with the hood team
            <BR>Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
        </P>
        <P>
            I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
            <BR>Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
            <BR>I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
            <BR>And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
        </P>
        <P>
            Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
            <BR>I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
            <BR>I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
            <BR>The way things is goin', I don't know
        </P>
        <P>
            Tell me why are we so blind to see
            <BR>That the ones we hurt are you and me?
        </P>
        <P>
            Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

        </P>
        <P>
            Power and the money, money and the power
            <BR>Minute after minute, hour after hour
            <BR>Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
            <BR>It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
        </P>
        <P>
            They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
            <BR>If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
            <BR>I guess they can't, I guess they won't
            <BR>I guess they frontin', that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!
        </P>
